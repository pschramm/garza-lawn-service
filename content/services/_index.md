# Local and Friendly Lawn Services

Having your lawn properly & regularly mowed is one of the most important things to do to keep it healthy. Properly mowed lawns will have fewer weeds, hold moisture better, have a higher stress tolerance and are typically better quality than lawns not properly mowed. Grasses are like most plants, when you clip off the top, they branch out and become denser, which turns all of those little grass plants into a tightly woven turf or a lawn. Not just mowing, but mowing height and mowing frequency determine how healthy and attractive your lawn looks.
