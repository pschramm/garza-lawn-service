Over time your soil becomes compacted making it hard to have a healthy lawn. Your roots can't get oxygen and nutrients. Core Aeration is the process of extracting finger sized plugs of soil from your yard. This in turn **lets your soil breathe**, stimulating root growth and enhancing nutrient and water intake.

We recommend you have your lawn aerated once a year.
