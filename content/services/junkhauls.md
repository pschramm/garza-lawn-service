JUNK is anything, in any condition, you no longer want or need.

REMOVAL means "We Make It Go Away". If it's in good shape, we'll donate it. If it's too far past its prime, we'll recycle it. If it cannot be donated or recycled, it will be disposed of properly. Our full-service Junk Removal teams will remove and haul the items from wherever they're located. No need to take them to the curb, or even outside. We'll gladly pick up one or ten items, or do a total clean-up of an estate, rental property, construction site, or closed business. And yes, we meant to say "one or ten" items!
