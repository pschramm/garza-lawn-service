## We are Garza Family Lawn Service


Take back your weekends and leave the mowing to us! No matter what your budget is, we are here to keep your lawn green and looking beautiful.

We provide weekly or bi-weekly lawn care plans for you to choose from so that you can select the level of attention that your lawn needs. We mow both your front and back lawn and weed around concrete areas, then blow all of these areas clean. And we always shut the gate!
## JUST RIGHT LAWNS SPECIAL
This is tailored to fit the different growth patterns of grasses located in Central Texas. We provide this service weekly when the grass is growing the fastest and every other week when growth slows down. Customers that pick this schedule are our happiest customers!

## WEEKLY MOWING
We have years of experience with the lawns of Austin and San Antonio and find that weekly mowing is the best way to keep your lawn beautiful. Our lawn care experts will cut lawns a little higher during the summer months, leaving your lawn with softer and greener blades.

Our weekly plan offers additional care during spring and periods of heavy rain when your lawn is growing faster. We will work with you to create the best schedule for you and your lawn.

## BI-WEEKLY MOWING
Our bi-weekly maintenance plan is great for any size yard in the Austin and San Antonio area. Our lawn care experts will come out every other week. Our service is made to keep your lawn maintained for the two weeks between service.
